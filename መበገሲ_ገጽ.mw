This is the place for the wikipedia in '''Tigrinya''' language.

It hasn't started yet, but '''you''' can start it; just clikc on ''edit this page'' and start adding content.

For more information, and to see what it could look like you can see the Wikipedias in [http://en.wikipedia.org/ English] or [http://eo.wikipedia.org/ Esperanto] (and follow there the help and tutorials).

Please use UTF-8 for the charactes used by Tigrinya language, it works perfectly: ኣብችደፍግሂጅክልምኖፕቅርስቱቭውሽይዝ... (of course you are free to replace that nonsense with some real meaningful text)
