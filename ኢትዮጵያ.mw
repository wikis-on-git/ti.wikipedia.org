== Etymology ==
The [[:en:Greek_language|Greek]] name [[:en:Aethiopia|Αἰθιοπία]] (from {{lang|grc|Αἰθίοψ}}, ''Aithiops'', "an Ethiopian") is a compound word, derived from the two Greek words, from {{lang|grc|αἴθω}} + {{lang|grc|ὤψ}} (''aitho'' "I burn" + ''ops'' "face"). According to the Perseus Digital Library, the designation properly translates as ''Burnt-face'' in noun form and ''red-brown'' in adjectival form.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%232329&redirect=true|contribution=Aithiops|first1=Henry George|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus|accessdate=16 March 2009}}</ref> The historian [[:en:Herodotus|Herodotus]] used the appellation to denote those parts of Africa South of the [[:en:Sahara|Sahara]] that were then known within the [[:en:Ecumene|Ecumene]] (inhabitable world).<ref name="Herodotus1">For all references to Ethiopia in Herodotus, see: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/nebrowser?query=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&id=tgn%2C7000489 this list] at the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu Perseus project].</ref> However, the Greek formation may be a [[:en:Folk_etymology|folk etymology]] for the [[:en:Egyptian_language|Ancient Egyptian]] term ''athtiu-abu'', which means 'robbers of hearts'.<ref>Partridge, Eric.

In [[:en:Ancient_Greece|Greco]]-[[:en:Roman_Empire|Roman]] epigraphs, ''Aethiopia'' was a specific toponym for ancient [[:en:Nubia|Nubia]].<ref name="Hatke">{{cite book|last1=Hatke|first1=George|title=Aksum and Nubia: Warfare, Commerce, and Political Fictions in Ancient Northeast Africa|date=2013|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-6066-6|pages=52–53|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=PA4UCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA52}}</ref> At least as early as c. 850,<ref>[[Etymologicum Genuinum]] s.v. Αἰθιοπία; see also [[Aethiopia]]</ref> the name ''Aethiopia'' also occurs in many translations of the [[:en:Old_Testament|Old Testament]] in allusion to Nubia. The ancient [[:en:Hebrew_language|Hebrew]] texts identify Nubia instead as [[:en:Kingdom_of_Kush|Kush]].<ref>Cp. Ezekiel 29:10</ref> However, in the [[:en:New_Testament|New Testament]], the Greek term Aithiops does occur, referring to a servant of the [[:en:Kandake|Kandake]], the queen of Kush.<ref>Acts 8:27</ref>

Following the Hellenic and Biblical traditions, the [[:en:Monumentum_Adulitanum|Monumentum Adulitanum]], a third century inscription belonging to the [[:en:Aksumite_Empire|Aksumite Empire]], indicates that Aksum's then ruler governed an area which was flanked to the west by the territory of Ethiopia and Sasu. The Aksumite King [[:en:Ezana_of_Axum|Ezana]] would eventually conquer Nubia the following century, and the Aksumites thereafter appropriated the designation "Ethiopians" for their own kingdom. In the [[:en:Ge'ez_language|Ge'ez]] version of the Ezana inscription, Aἰθιόποι is equated with the unvocalized ''Ḥbšt'' and ''Ḥbśt'' (Ḥabashat), and denotes for the first time the highland inhabitants of Aksum. This new demonym would subsequently be rendered as '''ḥbs'' ('Aḥbāsh) in [[:en:Sabaic_language|Sabaic]] and as ''Ḥabasha'' in [[:en:Arabic_language|Arabic]].<ref name="Hatke" />

In the 15th-century Ge'ez ''[[:en:Book_of_Aksum|Book of Aksum]]'', the name is ascribed to a legendary individual called ''[[:en:Ityopp'is|Ityopp'is]]''. He was an extra-Biblical son of [[:en:Cush_(Bible)|Cush, son of Ham]], said to have founded the city of [[:en:Axum|Axum]].<ref name="Agrvt">{{cite book|title=Africa Geoscience Review, Volume 10|date=2003|publisher=Rock View International|page=366|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref>

In English, and generally outside of Ethiopia, the country was once historically known as Abyssinia. This [[:en:Toponym|toponym]] was derived from the Latinized form of the ancient ''Habash''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schoff|first1=Wilfred Harvey|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: travel and trade in the Indian Ocean|date=1912|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|page=62|url=https://archive.org/stream/periplusoferythr00schouoft#page/62/mode/2up|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref>

=== Antiquity ===
{{Main|Dʿmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}
[[File:ET_Axum_asv2018-01_img37_Stelae_Park.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ET_Axum_asv2018-01_img37_Stelae_Park.jpg|thumb|[[:en:Obelisk_of_Aksum|Obelisk of Aksum]]]]
Around the 8th century BC, a kingdom known as [[:en:Dʿmt|Dʿmt]] was established in [[:en:Tigray_Region|Tigray]], in northern Ethiopia, and [[:en:Eritrea|Eritrea]]. The polity's capital was located at [[:en:Yeha|Yeha]], in northern Ethiopia. Most modern historians consider this civilization to be a native Ethiopian one, although [[:en:Sabaeans|Sabaean]]-influenced because of the latter's hegemony of the Red Sea.<ref name="Munro-Hay57" />

Other scholars regard Dʿmt as the result of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local Agaw peoples and Sabaeans from [[:en:South_Arabia|South Arabia]]. However, [[:en:Ge'ez_language|Ge'ez]], the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia, is thought to have developed independently from [[:en:Sabaean_language|Sabaean]], one of the [[:en:South_Semitic_languages|South Semitic languages]]. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in Ethiopia and Eritrea where Ge'ez developed.<ref>Tamrat, Taddesse (1972) ''Church and State in Ethiopia: 1270–1527''. London: Oxford University Press, pp. 5–13.</ref><ref>Uhlig, Siegbert (ed.) (2005) ''[[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]]'', "Ge'ez". Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, p. 732.</ref> Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the Ethiopian civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Aksumite state.<ref name="Munro-Hay57" />

The inscriptions in [[:en:Ancient_Greek|Ancient Greek]] read "ΑΧΩΜΙΤΩ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ" ("KING OF AXUM") and "ΕΝΔΥΒΙΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ" ("KING ENDUBIS"), the Greek language was the [[:en:Lingua_franca|lingua franca]] by that time so the [[:en:Axumite_kings|Axumite kings]] used it in coins to simplify foreign trade.]]
After the fall of Dʿmt during the fourth century BC, the Ethiopian plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. In the first century AD, the [[:en:Kingdom_of_Aksum|Kingdom of Aksum]] emerged in what is now [[:en:Tigray_Region|Tigray]] and Eritrea. According to the medieval ''[[:en:Book_of_Aksum|Book of Aksum]]'', the kingdom's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.<ref name="Agrvt" /> Aksum would later at times extend its rule into Yemen on the other side of the Red Sea.<ref>{{cite book|first=David W.|last=Phillipson|title=Ancient Ethiopia.

Around 316 AD, [[:en:Frumentius|Frumentius]] and his brother Edesius from [[:en:Tyre,_Lebanon|Tyre]] accompanied their uncle on a voyage to Ethiopia. When the vessel stopped at a Red Sea port, the natives killed all the travellers except the two brothers, who were taken to the court as [[:en:Slavery_in_Ethiopia|slaves]]. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity.

The weakened Axumite dynasty came to an end in the 9th century when Yodit defeated the last king of the dynasty. Empress Yodit's reign, which lasted for 40 years, aimed to abolish Christianity (a religion first accepted by King Ezana of the Axumite dynasty) by burning down churches and crucifying people who remained faithful to the orthodox Tewahedo church, which at the time was considered as the religion of the state. The Empress tried to force many people to change their religion and destroyed much historical heritage of the Axumite dynasty earning her the epithet of Yodit Gudit (in Amharic ዮዲት ጉዲት). Her reign finally came to an end in 912 following her defeat by the first leader of the Zagwe dynasty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tegelachen|last=Haile Mariam|first=Mengistu|publisher=corneal Mengistu Haile Mariam|year=2004|location=Ethiopia|pages=16–21}}</ref> The reign of the Zagwe dynasty came to an end by the rise of [[:en:Yekuno_Amlak|Yekuno Amlak]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Greville Stewart Parker Freeman-Grenville|author2=Stuart Christopher Munro-Hay|title=Islam: An Illustrated History|date=2006|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-6533-6|pages=177–78|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=3fKoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA177}}</ref>

{{Main|Migration to Abyssinia|List of expeditions of Muhammad|Hegira}}The first interaction that the Islamic Prophet [[:en:Muhammad|Muhammad]] had with Ethiopia was during the reign of [[:en:Aṣḥama_ibn_Abjar|Aṣḥama ibn Abjar]], who was at the time the Emperor of [[:en:Aksum|Aksum]] and gave refuge to several [[:en:Muslim|Muslims]] in the [[:en:Kingdom_of_Aksum|Kingdom of Aksum]] in 614 AD.<ref>[[Fiaccadori, Gianfranco]] (2005) "Ellä Säham" in ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica'', vol. 2, Wiesbaden</ref> According to other authors, Ashama may have been the same person as king [[:en:Armah|Armah]], or his father or son.<ref>Hable Sellassie, Sergew (1972).

The [[:en:Zagwe_dynasty|Zagwe dynasty]] ruled many parts of present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea between the early 12th and late 13th century. The name of the [[:en:Dynasty|dynasty]] is derived from the Cushitic-speaking [[:en:Agaw_people|Agaw]] of northern Ethiopia.

{{Main|Sultanate of Aussa|Mudaito Dynasty}}The [[:en:Sultanate_of_Aussa|Sultanate of Aussa]] or "Afar Sultanate" succeeded the earlier [[:en:Imamate_of_Aussa|Imamate of Aussa]]. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577 when [[:en:Muhammed_Jasa|Muhammed Jasa]] moved his capital from [[:en:Harar|Harar]] to Aussa ([[:en:Asaita|Asaita]]) with the split of the [[:en:Adal_Sultanate|Adal Sultanate]] into the Sultanate of Aussa and the [[:en:Sultanate_of_Harar|Sultanate of Harar]].

Between 1755 and 1855, Ethiopia experienced a period of isolation referred to as the ''[[:en:Zemene_Mesafint|Zemene Mesafint]]'' or "Age of Princes". The Emperors became figureheads, controlled by regional lords and noblemen like [[:en:Ras_(title)|''Ras'']] [[:en:Mikael_Sehul|Mikael Sehul]] of [[:en:Tigray_Province|Tigray]], [[:en:Ras_(title)|''Ras'']] [[:en:Wolde_Selassie|Wolde Selassie]] of Tigray, and by the Were Sheh[[:en:Yejju_Oromo_tribe|Yejju Oromo dynasty]], such as ''Ras'' [[:en:Gugsa_of_Yejju|Gugsa of Yejju]]. Prior to the Zemene Mesafint, King Iyoas had introduced Oromo as the language of the court from Amharic to [[:en:Oromo_language|Afaan Oromo]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Pankhurst, Richard|title=The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles|location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1967|pages=139–143}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gargaaraoromopc.org/OPC_Program.aspx|title=Political Program of the Oromo People's Congress (OPC)|publisher=Gargaaraoromopc.org|date=23 April 1996|accessdate=16 March 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307213227/http://gargaaraoromopc.org/OPC_Program.aspx|archivedate=7 March 2009}}</ref>

Ethiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that concluded an alliance between the two nations, but it was not until 1855 that the Amhara kingdoms of northern Ethiopia (Gonder, Gojam, Shoa) were briefly united after the power of the Emperor was restored beginning with the reign of [[:en:Tewodros_II|Tewodros II]].  Tewodros had been born in [[:en:Begemder|Begemder]] from a nobleman of [[:en:Qwara_Province|Qwara]], where the [[:en:Qwara_dialect|Qwara dialect]] of the Agaw language is spoken.

Upon his ascent, he began [[:en:Modernization_theory|modernizing]] Ethiopia and recentralizing power in the Emperor.

But Tewodros suffered several rebellions inside his empire. Northern Oromo militias, Tigrayan rebellion, and the constant incursion of Ottoman Empire and Egyptian forces near the Red Sea brought the weakening and the final downfall of Tewodros II. He killed himself in 1868 during his last fight with the [[:en:British_Expedition_to_Abyssinia|British Expedition to Abyssinia]] at the [[:en:Battle_of_Magdala|Battle of Magdala]].

For his leadership, despite opposition from more traditional elements of society, Menelik II is heralded as a national hero. Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889 in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control an area north of Ethiopia (now part of modern Eritrea). In return, Italy was to provide Menelik with weapons and support him as emperor.

The early 20th century was marked by the reign of Emperor [[:en:Haile_Selassie|Haile Selassie]] ''(Ras Tafari)''. Haile Selassie I was born to parents with ethnic links to three of Ethiopia's Afroasiatic-speaking populations: the ''Oromo'' and ''Amhara'', the country's two largest ethnic groups, as well as the [[:en:Gurage_people|Gurage]].

The independence of Ethiopia was interrupted by the [[:en:Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War|Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], beginning when it was invaded by [[:en:Kingdom_of_Italy#Fascist_regime_(1922%E2%80%931943)|Fascist Italy]] in early October 1935, and Italian occupation of the country (1936–1941).<ref>Clapham, Christopher (2005) "Ḫaylä Śəllase" in Siegbert von Uhlig, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha''.

The Italians made investments in Ethiopian infrastructure development during their occupation. They created the so-called "imperial road" between Addis Ababa and Massaua.<ref>[http://media.tecnici.it/file/novecento/autocamionale_assab_addis-abeba.pdf 1940 Article on the special road Addis Ababa-Assab and map (in Italian)]</ref> More than 900&nbsp;km of railways were reconstructed, dams and hydroelectric plants were built, and many public and private companies were established.

He dissolved this in 1962 and [[:en:Annexation|annexed]] Eritrea, resulting in the [[:en:Eritrean_War_of_Independence|Eritrean War of Independence]].

Opinion within Ethiopia turned against Haile Selassie I owing to the worldwide [[:en:1973_oil_crisis|1973 oil crisis]].

The ensuing government suffered several coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and a huge refugee problem.

The [[:en:1983–85_famine_in_Ethiopia|1983–85 famine in Ethiopia]] affected around eight million people, resulting in one million dead. Insurrections against Communist rule sprang up, particularly in the northern regions of Eritrea and Tigray. The [[:en:Tigrayan_People's_Liberation_Front|Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) merged with other ethnically-based opposition movements in 1989, to form the coalition known as the [[:en:Ethiopian_People's_Revolutionary_Democratic_Front|Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF).<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Genocide in Africa|last=Stapleton|first=Timothy J.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4408-3052-5|location=|page=163}}</ref>

Concurrently, the Soviet Union began to retreat from building world communism under [[:en:Mikhail_Gorbachev|Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s ''[[:en:Glasnost|glasnost]]'' and ''[[:en:Perestroika|perestroika]]'' policies, marking a dramatic reduction in aid to Ethiopia from Socialist Bloc countries.

The government initiated a crackdown in the provinces as well; in Oromia state the authorities used concerns over insurgency and terrorism to use torture, imprisonment, and other repressive methods to silence critics following the election, particularly people sympathetic to the registered opposition party [[:en:Oromo_National_Congress|Oromo National Congress]] (ONC).<ref name="HRW Ethiopia" /> The government has been engaged in a conflict with rebels in the [[:en:Ogaden|Ogaden]] region since 2007.

Before 1996, Ethiopia was divided into thirteen [[:en:Provinces_of_Ethiopia|provinces]], many derived from historical regions. The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a [[:en:Federal_government|federal government]] overseeing ethnically based regional states, zones, [[:en:Districts_of_Ethiopia|districts]] (''woreda''), and ''[[:en:Kebele|kebeles]]'' ("neighbourhoods").

Since 1996, Ethiopia has been divided into nine ethnically-based and politically autonomous [[:en:Regions_of_Ethiopia|regional states]] (''kililoch'', singular ''kilil''&#x2009;) and two chartered cities (''astedader akababiwoch'', singular ''astedader akababi''&#x2009;), the latter being [[:en:Addis_Ababa|Addis Ababa]] and [[:en:Dire_Dawa|Dire Dawa]]. The ''kililoch'' are subdivided into sixty-eight [[:en:Zones_of_Ethiopia|zones]], and then further into 550 ''woredas'' and several special ''woredas''.

The constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.

Article 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus. Such elaborate structure of council, executive, and sectoral public institutions is replicated to the next level (''woreda'').

It lies between the [[:en:3rd_parallel_north|3rd parallel north]] and the [[:en:15th_parallel_north|15th parallel north]] and longitudes [[:en:33rd_meridian_east|33rd meridian east]] and [[:en:48th_meridian_east|48th meridian east]].

The major portion of Ethiopia lies in the [[:en:Horn_of_Africa|Horn of Africa]], which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, the ''de facto'' state of [[:en:Somaliland|Somaliland]], Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the [[:en:Great_Rift_Valley,_Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, [[:en:Steppe|steppes]], or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.

Ethiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive [[:en:Afromontane|Afromontane]] in the northern and southwestern parts. [[:en:Lake_Tana|Lake Tana]] in the north is the source of the [[:en:Blue_Nile|Blue Nile]]. It also has many [[:en:Endemism|endemic]] species, notably the [[:en:Gelada|gelada]], the [[:en:Walia_ibex|walia ibex]] and the [[:en:Ethiopian_wolf|Ethiopian wolf]] ("Simien fox"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.

{{Main|Geography of Ethiopia#Climate}}
[[File:Semien_Mountains_13.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Semien_Mountains_13.jpg|thumb|[[:en:Semien_Mountains|Semien Mountains]]]]
The predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The [[:en:Ethiopian_Highlands|Ethiopian Highlands]] cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around {{convert|2000|–|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.
[[File:Wonchi_Lake_of_Ethiopia.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wonchi_Lake_of_Ethiopia.jpg|left|thumb|Wonchi Lake]]
The modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of [[:en:Mount_Entoto|Mount Entoto]] at an elevation of around {{convert|2400|m}}. It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1200|mm|}}.

There are on average seven hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is {{convert|16|°C|°F|1}}, with daily maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|20|-|25|°C|°F|1}} throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging {{convert|5|-|10|°C|°F|1}}.

Most major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying [[:en:Ethiopian_xeric_grasslands_and_shrublands|Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the [[:en:Danakil_Depression|Danakil Depression]] in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of {{convert|34|°C|°F|1}}.

In spite of fast growth in recent years, GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and the economy faces a number of serious structural problems.

The Ethiopian [[:en:Constitution|constitution]] defines the right to own land as belonging only to "the state and the people", but citizens may lease land (up to 99 years), and are unable to mortgage or sell. Renting of land for a maximum of twenty years is allowed and this is expected to ensure that land goes to the most productive user. Land distribution and administration is considered an area where corruption is institutionalized, and facilitation payments as well as bribes are often demanded when dealing with land-related issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Business Corruption in Ethiopia|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/ethiopia/business-corruption-in-ethiopia.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=8 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406173808/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/ethiopia/business-corruption-in-ethiopia.aspx|archive-date=6 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> As there is no land ownership, infrastructural projects are most often simply done without asking the land users, which then end up being displaced and without home or land. A lot of anger and distrust sometimes results in public protests. In addition, agricultural productivity remains low, and frequent droughts still beset the country, also leading to internal displacement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Six_million_children_threatened_by_Ethiopia_drought_UN_999.html|title=Six million children threatened by Ethiopia drought: UN|publisher=Terradaily.com|accessdate=16 March 2009}}</ref>

=== Energy and hydropower ===

[[File:Renaissance_Dam_site.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Renaissance_Dam_site.jpg|thumb|Layout of the [[:en:Grand_Renaissance_Dam|Grand Renaissance Dam]]]]
Ethiopia has 14 major rivers flowing from its highlands, including the [[:en:Nile|Nile]]. It has the largest water reserves in Africa. {{as of|2012}}, hydroelectric plants represented around 88.2% of the total installed electricity generating capacity.

The remaining electrical power was generated from fossil fuels (8.3%) and renewable sources (3.6%).

The electrification rate for the total population in 2016 was 42%, with 85% coverage in urban areas and 26% coverage in rural areas. {{as of|2016}}, total electricity production was 11.15&nbsp;TW⋅h and consumption was 9.062&nbsp;TW⋅h. There were 0.166&nbsp;TW⋅h of electricity exported, 0&nbsp;kW⋅h imported, and 2.784&nbsp;GW of installed generating capacity.<ref name="CIA" />

Ethiopia delivers roughly 81% of water volume to the Nile through the river basins of the [[:en:Blue_Nile|Blue Nile]], [[:en:Sobat_River|Sobat River]] and [[:en:Atbara|Atbara]]. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the [[:en:Water_politics_in_the_Nile_Basin|1959 Nile Waters Agreement]], which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt has discouraged almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to utilize the local Nile tributaries. This had the effect of discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. However, Ethiopia is in the process of constructing a large 6,450 MW hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile river. When completed, this [[:en:Grand_Ethiopian_Renaissance_Dam|Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]] is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station in Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/31/business/ethiopia-grand-renaissance-dam/index.html|title=Ethiopia powers on with controversial dam project|author1=Victoria Eastwood|author2=Nima Elbagir|access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref>

The [[:en:Gilgel_Gibe_III_Dam|Gibe III]] hydroelectric project is so far the largest in the country with an installed capacity of 1,870&nbsp;MW. For the year 2017–18 (2010 E.C) this hydro electric dam generated 4,900&nbsp;GW⋅h.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2015/10/power-generation-begins-at-1-870-mw-gibe-iii-hydroelectric-project-in-ethiopia.html|title=Power generation begins at 1,870-MW Gibe III hydroelectric project in Ethiopia|website=www.hydroworld.com|access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref>

Agriculture constitutes around 85% of the labour force. However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the [[:en:Gross_domestic_product|GDP]].<ref name="CIA" /> Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include [[:en:Coffea|coffee]], [[:en:Legume|legumes]], [[:en:Rapeseed|oilseeds]], [[:en:Cereal|cereals]], potatoes, [[:en:Sugarcane|sugarcane]], and vegetables.

This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions, and promote regional integration.<ref name="ODI" /> However, the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.<ref name="ODI" /> Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.<ref name="ODI" />

"Ethiopia: A Country Study". Edited by Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1991. [http://countrystudies.us/ethiopia Countrystudies.us]</ref>

In 1936, Italy annexed Ethiopia, building infrastructure to connect major cities, and a dam providing power and water.<ref name="Accessed 15 May 2008">Shivley, K. "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia" [http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/kshively/index.html Macalester.edu].

The second period of growth was from 1967 to 1975 when rural populations migrated to urban centers seeking work and better living conditions.<ref name="countrystudies1991" />

This pattern slowed due to the 1975 Land Reform program instituted by the government, which provided incentives for people to stay in rural areas. As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970–1983. This program proliferated the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The act did lead to an increase in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform act.<ref name="Anderson, Frank 1991.

Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives. In peasant associations daily life is a struggle to survive. About 16% of the population in Ethiopia are living on less than one dollar per day (2008). Only 65% of rural households in Ethiopia consume the [[:en:World_Health_Organization|World Health Organization]]'s minimum standard of food per day (2,200 kilocalories), with 42% of children under 5 years old being underweight.<ref name="Crawley">Crawley, Mike.

The peasant associations face a cycle of poverty. Since the landholdings are so small, farmers cannot allow the land to lie fallow, which reduces soil fertility.<ref name="Crawley" /> This [[:en:Land_degradation|land degradation]] reduces the production of fodder for livestock, which causes low milk yields.<ref name="Crawley" /> Since the community burns livestock manure as fuel, rather than plowing the nutrients back into the land, the crop production is reduced.<ref name="Crawley" /> The low productivity of agriculture leads to inadequate incomes for farmers, hunger, malnutrition and disease.

Despite the living conditions in the cities, the people of Addis Ababa are much better off than people living in the peasant associations owing to their educational opportunities. Unlike rural children, 69% of urban children are enrolled in primary school, and 35% of those are eligible to attend secondary school.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}<ref name="Accessed 15 May 2008" /> Addis Ababa has its own [[:en:Addis_Ababa_University|university]] as well as many other secondary schools.

The low availability of health-care professionals with modern medical training, together with lack of funds for medical services, leads to the preponderance of less-reliable traditional healers that use home-based therapies to heal common ailments.

One common cultural practice, irrespective of religion or economic status, is [[:en:Female_genital_mutilation|female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), a procedure that involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ Female genital mutilation].

The Government of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia is signatory to various international conventions and treaties that protect the rights of women and children. Its constitution provides for the fundamental rights and freedoms for women. There is an attempt being made to raise the social and economic status of women through eliminating all legal and customary practices, which hinder women's equal participation in society and undermine their social status.

The National Mental Health Strategy, published in 2012, introduced the development of policy designed to improve mental health care in Ethiopia. This strategy mandated that mental health be integrated into the primary health care system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mhinnovation.net/resources/national-mental-health-strategy-ethiopia|title=National Mental Health Strategy of Ethiopia|date=14 August 2014|website=Mental Health Innovation Network}}</ref> However, the success of the National Mental Health Strategy has been limited.

Education in Ethiopia was dominated by the Tewahedo Church for many centuries until secular education was adopted in the early 1900s. The current system follows school expansion schemes which are very similar to the system in the rural areas during the 1980s, with an addition of deeper regionalization, providing rural education in students' own languages starting at the elementary level, and with more budget finances allocated to the education sector. The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, four years of lower secondary school and two years of higher secondary school.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Teferra|first1=Damtew|last2=Altbach|first2=Philip G.|title=African Higher Education: An International Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RROdAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34186-0|pages=316–25}}</ref>

=== Naming ===
{{Main|Naming conventions in Ethiopia and Eritrea}}Ethiopians have a different naming system to the [[:en:Family_name|family name]]-based Western system. Children add the [[:en:Given_name|given names]] of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family [[:en:Surname|surname]], and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first names.

Everyone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes ''Ato'' ('''አቶ''') is used for men; ''Weyzero'' ('''ወይዘሮ''') for married women; and ''Weyzerīt'' ('''ወይዘሪት''') for unmarried women.

=== Calendar ===

[[File:Celebrate_The_Return_of_Axum_Obelisk_(Detail)_(3172365788).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Celebrate_The_Return_of_Axum_Obelisk_(Detail)_(3172365788).jpg|thumb|Model commemorating the [[:en:Obelisk_of_Axum|Obelisk of Aksum]]'s return to Ethiopia from Italy, showing the date of its departure and return according to the [[:en:Ethiopian_calendar|Ethiopian calendar]]]]
Ethiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the [[:en:Ethiopian_calendar|Ethiopian calendar]], also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or [[:en:Coptic_calendar|Coptic calendar]], which in turn derives from the [[:en:Egyptian_calendar|Egyptian calendar]]. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six [[:en:Epagomenal|epagomenal]] days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.

Like the [[:en:Julian_calendar|Julian calendar]], the sixth epagomenal day—which in essence is a [[:en:Leap_day|leap day]]—is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1{{nbsp}}Mäskäräm, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September ([[:en:Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian]]), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the [[:en:Annunciation|Annunciation]] of [[:en:Jesus|Jesus]].

Another calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the [[:en:Oromo_people|Oromo]]. A lunar-stellar calendar, this [[:en:Oromo_calendar|Oromo calendar]] relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).<ref>{{cite web|first=Lawrence R|last=Doyle|url=http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm|title=The Borana Calendar Reinterpreted|work=tusker.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029073246/http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm|archivedate=29 October 2008}}</ref>

=== Time ===
[[:en:Time_in_Ethiopia|Time in Ethiopia]] is counted differently from most countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 06:00 as opposed to 00:00, coinciding with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) six hours to the Western time. For example, 02:00 local Addis Ababa time is called "8 at night" in Ethiopia, while 20:00 is called "2 in the evening".
